## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

Here I learnt how to use structural markup which includes elements such as <h1>, <h2>, and <p> and 
semantic markup which includes elements such as <strong> and <em>;
```html
<h1>Order Summary</h1>
<p> You can now listen to millions of songs,<br>
        audiobooks, and podcasts on any device <br>
        anywhere you like! </p>
<strong> Annual Plan </strong>
```

Here I learnt that to avoid a repitiion of the background image, the 'background-repeat' property should be used;
```css
  body {
    background-image: url("./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top;
  }
```

Here I learnt that If you are using the display property to define your div as a flex container, you have to use the justify-content property to center text horizontally within the div;
```css
  body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
  }
```


### Continued development

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- Resource 1 - (https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand basic HTML and CSS best practices. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- Resource 2 - (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - The MDN documentation is a great resource which helped me figured out which HTML/CSS tags, selectors, and properties to use to get my desired design. 

- Resource 3 - (https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This is an amazing article which helped me to finally understand ways to center Div or text in Div in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- Resource 4 - Book - HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites By Jon Duckett - I highly recommend this book for both newbies and professionals who wants to have a great knowledge of HTML and CSS and those who want to learn how to design and build websites from scratch.
